stralnumcmp
===========

A comparator for text mixed alphabet and numeric characters in C
language, Python and Perl, which enables sort like the followings:

    9km
    10km

or

    part9.mp4
    part10.mp4

NOTE: GNU has [strverscmp(3)](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/String_002fArray-Comparison.html#index-strverscmp-571)
in libc(3) which seems to do similar, but not the same.
